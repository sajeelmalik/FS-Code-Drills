# Accessibility

**Accessibility** is an often-overlooked part of building and designing web pages. It ensures that all different types of users, especially those with disabilities, have an equal experience when visiting any web page.

## Principles of Accessibility

The principles of accessibility, based on the International standards from W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), generally dictate that user interfaces (UIs) should be perceivable, operable, and understandable. 

```
That is, any type of user should be able to see, use, and understand the interface easily.

*The following principles should be loosely understood! Do not memorize or spend too much time on these - just proceed to the code drills.*

#### 1. Perceivable information and user interface
- Text alternatives for non-text content 
    - Alternate text for images, icons, and graphics
    - Descriptions of data on charts, diagrams, and illustrations
    - Brief descriptions of non-text content like videos and audio
    - Labels for form inputs
- Captions and other alternatives for multimedia
- Content can be presented in different ways. For users to be able to change the presentation of content, it is necessary that:
    - Headings, lists, tables and other structures in the content are marked-up properly
    - Browsers and assistive technologies provide settings to customize the presentation.
- Content is easier to see and hear
    - Color is not used as the only way of conveying information or identifying content;
    - Default foreground and background color combinations provide sufficient contrast;
    - Text is resizable up to 200% without losing information, using a standard browser;
    - Images of text are resizable, replaced with actual text, or avoided where possible;
    - Users can pause, stop, or adjust the volume of audio that is played on a website;
    - Background audio is low or can be turned off, to avoid interference or distraction.

#### 2. Operable user interface and navigation

#### 3. Understandtable user interface 

#### 4. Robust and reliable Interpretation
